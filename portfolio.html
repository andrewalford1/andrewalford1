                I acted as the <b>lead developer</b> on DoseVision2, a Software as a Service (SAAS) product, which I saw through from conception to completion. Our service allows organisations to monitor and manage the radiation exposure of it's employees from anywhere in the world via sophisticated Personal Electronic Dosimeters (PEDs) which sync up to a cloud web portal through desktop and mobile applications. My roles and responsibilities on this product included:

                <li>Coordinating a Scrum team of both software engineers and UX developers</li>

                <li>and implementing core functionality, such as interfacing with PEDs and synchronising data to and from our API.</li>

                Another significant contribution to the buisness I've made is to design and implement a prototype for the interactive reports used for Tracerco's Insights Platform. My prototype took legacy report data on customer's distillation towers and used D3.js to create an interactable CAD model embedded within a web portal. Following my contributions, the Insights Platform has gone on to become one of Tracerco's most successful products and has recieved <b>significant recognition by winning the "Teesside Innovation Award" in July 2023</b>.

        <p>For my Undergraduate Dissertation, I created CPU Online. Designed to be a modernisation of JASPer, an older desktop application with similar functionality, CPU Online is a web-based CPU simulator which can visualise interactive registers and memory; teachs, in real-time, the 'Fetch, Decode and Execute' cycle; supports it's own in-built assembly language to allow users to write and run their own programs; and provides accessibilty functionality to pause, play, speed up, slow down, or step through executing programs.</p>

        <img class="h-96" src="res/portfolio/galaxy_adventure.jpg"/>
        <p>Galaxy Adventure is an interactive VR application created using THREE JS. There are two ways to interact with this project. Firstly, players can pilot a little airplane and explore the galaxy by moving their head to fly the airplane in the direction their facing. Secondly, for players who just want to view and interact with the planets created for the game, an Object Viewer mode was added.</p>

        <img class="h-96" src="res/portfolio/christmas_game.jpg"/>
        <p>Coded using C++, Christmas Conundrum allows the player to take control of Santa Claus who can kick, punch and throw deadly exploding presents. It was created to showcase additions I contributed to a pre-existing Direct-X game engine (the Shell Engine). My contributions were to implement a component-based architecture for game entities with an object manger; functionality to load in and animate game characters via sprite sheets; the ability to play music and sound effects; collision detection and handling; and finally, a tiling system to create the game world.</p>

        <img class="h-96" src="res/portfolio/crazy_carnival.jpg"/>
        <p>Just like Galaxy Adventure, Crazy Carnival uses THREE JS to create an interactive animated scene. Players are able to explore and interact with the environment via gesture tracking with a Microsoft Kinect. Developed with three other students, Crazy Carnival is a much larger project than Galaxy Adventure which included four interactable mini-games: bowling, football, a strength test and whack-a-mole.</p>
