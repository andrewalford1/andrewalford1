    I am a full-stack software engineer, and certified Scrum Master, from Newcastle upon Tyne who specialises in dotnet development. I have experience in the Measurements Insights industry, producing best-in-class applications for desktop, mobile and web. Outside of the office I am passionate about volunteering, hiking, building Lego, board gaming and cinema.

  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <div>  
    <hgroup>
      <h3>Tracerco, <span>Software Engineer</span></h3>
      <h4>July 2019 - Present | Billingham, Teesside</h4>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
      At Tracerco I work on and lead multiple full-stack projects covering desktop, mobile and web applications. We're a dotnet-based company, using Azure, WPF, Xamarin, ASP.net and Angular.
    </p>
    <p>
      I acted as the <b>lead developer</b> on DoseVision2, a Software as a Service (SAAS) product, which I saw through from conception to completion. Our service allows organisations to monitor and manage the radiation exposure of it's employees from anywhere in the world via sophisticated Personal Electronic Dosimeters (PEDs) which sync up to a cloud web portal through desktop and mobile applications. My roles and responsibilities on this product included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coordinating a Scrum team of both software engineers and UX developers</li>
      <li>Collaborating with product stakeholders, firmware and hardware teams</li>
      <li>and implementing core functionality, such as interfacing with PEDs and synchronising data to and from our API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Another significant contribution to the business I've made is to design and implement a prototype for the interactive reports used for Tracerco's Insights Platform. My prototype took legacy report data on customer's distillation towers and used D3.js to create an interactable CAD model embedded within a web portal. Following my contributions, the Insights Platform has gone on to become one of Tracerco's most successful products and has received <b>significant recognition by winning the "Teesside Innovation Award" in July 2023</b>.
